A logic game
Count to 100 with 10 friends
    Each person count a number then pass to the next
    Whenever the number is divisible by 7, they switch directions. So person 6 will say "6", person 7 will say "7", then person 6 again will say "8".
    Whenever the number is divisible by 11, they skip the next person.


PROGRAM CounterGame
    friend = 1
    countDirection = "RIGHT"
    FOR (numberCount = 1; numberCount < 100; numberCount++) DO
        WHILE friend > 0 AND friend < 11 DO
                IF numberCount % 7 = 0 THEN
                    IF countDirection == "LEFT" THEN
                        countDirection = "RIGHT"
                    ELSE countDirection = "LEFT"
                ELSE if numberCount % 11 = 0 THEN
                    IF countDirection == "RIGHT" THEN
                        friend += 1
                    ELSE friend -= 1

            IF countDirection == "RIGHT" THEN
                friend += 1
